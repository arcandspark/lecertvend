Usage: lecertvend <command> [args]

Environment variables must be set for vault: VAULT_TOKEN, VAULT_ADDR

Command is one of:
  -vend    Issues a certificate or renew it if it
           exists and is aging
  -renew   Examine each certificat in a prefix
           and renew it if it is aging

Common Options:
  -mindays Renew an existing cert if it has fewer than this many days of
           validity remaining. Default is 30
  -mount   Vault mount point for the secret engine, must be a kv2
  -prefix  Path to cert secrets in the kv2 engine, do not include the mount
           point, or the data/ prefix.
           The last component of the prefix is presumed to be the DNS domain
           name for which certs will be vended.
  -cert    The secret name for the cert. This is usually the host name, but is
           provided explicitly for clearer naming for bare domain certs or
           certs with many SANs.

Options for -vend:
  -names   A comma separated list of host names for which to issue a
           certificate. All host names specified will be SANs on the single new
           certificate.
           A dot (.) by itself is interpreted as a request to issue the
           certificate for the bare DNS name.

Options for -renew:
  None

Examples:

Issue or renew the cert for example.com and www.example.com:
lecertvend -vend -names www,. \
  -mount secret -prefix lecertmgmt/demoteam/example.com -cert www

Renew all certs in the Vault for example.com:
lecertvend -renew -mount secret -prefix lecertmgmt/demoteam
